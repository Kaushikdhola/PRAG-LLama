This work is provided for personal evaluation and development use only. Redistribution, sharing, or any form of public or commercial distribution of this work, either in its current form or any modified version, is strictly prohibited.

Statement of Purpose

The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator and subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an "owner") of an original work of authorship and/or a database (each, a "Work").

Certain owners wish to permanently retain those rights to a Work to ensure it is not distributed, shared, or redistributed, whether in original or modified form. These owners may wish to keep the Work private and restricted to personal or internal use, without any form of public release or distribution.

For these purposes, the person associating this custom license with a Work (the "Affirmer") voluntarily elects to apply this license to the Work with the intention that the Work shall not be distributed, shared, or otherwise made publicly available.

Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under this license may be protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights ("Copyright and Related Rights"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited to, the following:

i. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate, and translate a Work;
ii. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);
iii. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or likeness depicted in a Work;
iv. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work, subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;
v. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use, and reuse of data in a Work;
vi. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, and under any national implementation thereof, including any amended or successor version of such directive); and
vii. other similar, equivalent, or corresponding rights throughout the world based on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations thereof.

No Distribution. The Work is provided under this license with the express condition that it shall not be distributed, shared, or otherwise made available to the public, either in original or modified form. This restriction applies to all forms of distribution, including but not limited to, physical copies, digital copies, sharing via networks, or publication in any medium.

Public License Fallback. Should any part of the "No Distribution" clause for any reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the license shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the extent the "No Distribution" clause is so judged, Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a royalty-free, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable, and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work with the express restriction that the Work shall not be distributed, shared, or otherwise made publicly available.
